# Analyzing Smoker Dataset: Machine Learning Discoveries

This repository contains the code for analyzing smoking status by using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning techniques. The code is written in Python and aims to explore [Smoker Status Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravduttakiit/smoker-status-prediction) dataset, build predictive models and gain insights into the factors influencing smoking habits.

If you would like to read the [Medium article](https://medium.com/@beratdincerr/analyzing-smoker-dataset-machine-learning-discoveries-7f548faa098b) I wrote to explain the code, you can click here and read the article while checking the code.

## Overview

- `main.ipynb` notebook contains the code.
- plots folder contains 2 plots that were plotted.
- `train_dataset.csv` contains the dataset that was used to train the machine learning models
